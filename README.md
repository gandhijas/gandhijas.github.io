# Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning: Exploring Quantum Classifiers

## Project Idea
This project explores how quantum computing concepts like qubits, quantum gates, and entanglement can be applied to machine learning tasks, focusing on building a conceptual framework for a simple quantum classifier.

## Background

### Context
Classical machine learning relies on processing large datasets using linear algebra, probability, and optimization. As datasets grow exponentially, classical methods become slower and more resource-intensive. Quantum computing offers a potential advantage by leveraging principles like **superposition** and **entanglement** to process information in parallel, enabling new kinds of machine learning models.  

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) aims to merge the predictive power of ML with the unique computational benefits of quantum algorithms. Techniques like **variational quantum circuits (VQCs)** have shown promise for tasks such as classification and clustering.

### Motivation
AI is one of the fastest-growing areas of technology, but its computational needs are outpacing classical hardware capabilities. This project is motivated by the belief that **quantum computing could accelerate certain ML tasks** and open the door to solving problems that are currently infeasible. By studying quantum classifiers, I hope to understand how QML algorithms differ fundamentally from classical models, and why they could matter for the future of AI.

## Goals
This project connects my interests in **math, quantum computing, and AI** by exploring one of the most promising emerging fields: Quantum Machine Learning. After MathQuantum, I want to dive deeper into quantum algorithms and how they intersect with finance and machine learning.

## (Optional) Quantum Classifier Code Snippet
Here is a tiny **example** of what a simple quantum circuit for a classifier might look like using Qiskit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a 1-qubit quantum circuit with 1 classical bit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)

# Example "data encoding" step
qc.h(0)  # Put qubit into superposition
qc.rx(1.0, 0)  # Rotate qubit to encode a feature

# "Model" step (just a simple gate here)
qc.rz(0.5, 0)

# Measurement
qc.measure(0, 0)

# Run the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000).result()
counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the results
plot_histogram(counts)
plt.show()
