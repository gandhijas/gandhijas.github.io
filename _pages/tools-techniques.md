## Tools / Techniques

### Mathematics & Concepts
- **Linear Algebra & Hilbert Spaces**: State vectors, unitary gates, tensor products.
- **Probability & Statistics**: Quantum measurement postulates; classification metrics.
- **Optimization**: Training **variational quantum circuits** with gradient-based or gradient-free methods.
- **(Finance) Portfolio / Risk Math** (contextual): Regime labels can be tied to **drawdowns, realized volatility, Sharpe changes**, etc.
- **Feature Engineering**: Simple technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, volatility, momentum).

### (Optional) Practical Tools You’d Use If You Built It
- **Qiskit / PennyLane** – to define and train the VQC on a simulator.
- **Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)** – to engineer features, define a classical baseline, and visualize results.
- **Qiskit Finance** – optional, for ready-made finance datasets/utilities.
