## Goals
This project connects my interests in **math, quantum computing, and AI** by exploring one of the most promising emerging fields: Quantum Machine Learning. After MathQuantum, I plan to dive deeper into quantum algorithms and how they intersect with finance, cryptography, and machine learning. This mini-project serves as a stepping stone toward future research or internships that involve **quantum-enhanced AI**.
