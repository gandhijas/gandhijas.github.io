## Background

### Context
Classical machine learning relies on processing large datasets using linear algebra, probability, and optimization. As datasets grow exponentially, classical methods become slower and more resource-intensive. Quantum computing offers a potential advantage by leveraging principles like **superposition** and **entanglement** to process information in parallel, enabling new kinds of machine learning models.  

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) aims to merge the predictive power of ML with the unique computational benefits of quantum algorithms. Techniques like **variational quantum circuits (VQCs)** have shown promise for tasks such as classification and clustering.

### Motivation
AI is one of the fastest-growing areas of technology, but its computational needs are outpacing classical hardware capabilities. This project is motivated by the belief that **quantum computing could accelerate certain ML tasks** and open the door to solving problems that are currently infeasible. By studying quantum classifiers, I hope to understand how QML algorithms differ fundamentally from classical models, and why they could matter for the future of AI.
